It's been a long day. It's been a long night before that. And a long night this 1. So it's just me in front of a microphone right now, looking at a 28 ounce bottle of water that tastes like watermelon. Just me in the water, happily reunited in the desert of human experience. I'm also surrounded by 3 computer screens that all have beautiful wallpaper looking at me, taunting me with beautiful picturesque scenes of nature. And I just before this played about 10 minutes of Diablo where I got to escape to a whole other world that is also picturesque but not with nature but filled with the intense intimidating sounds of demons attacking you from all sides. And all of that is somehow relaxing. Anyway, element is not just delicious it combines this perfect amount of magnesium, potassium, and sodium, watermelon salt.

It has 2 sides of the bed so you can cool or heat each side of the bed separately. I've actually recently was briefly at a get-together of a lot of really interesting people and somebody brought up the topic of a sleep and I just heard that a bunch of other folks said oh, I love a sleep They started talking about the different temperatures that they use and I was shocked and horrified to learn that some people actually heat their bed up. This was a fascinating discovery for me because I've never never even tried the heating feature. I always cool the bed. Sometimes it's very cold with a warm blanket, it's heaven. But I can't recommend it enough. Sleep really is a magical place. It's a bit surreal saying these words while quite sleep deprived, a bit melancholic, a bit hopeful.

But more seriously, thinking about the wars going on in the world today. And as you know, war and military conquest has been a big part of Roman society and culture. And it, I think, has been a big part of most empires and dynasties throughout human history. Yeah, they usually came as a result of conquest. I mean, there's some like the Austro-Hungarian Empire where there was just a lot of sort of clever marriages. But fundamentally there's an engine of conquest and they celebrate excellence in warfare. Many of the leaders were excellent generals, that kind of thing. So big picture question, Grok approved. I asked this is a good question to ask. Did you test it, Grok approved? Yeah, at least on fun mode. To what degree do you think war is part of human nature versus a consequence of how human societies are structured. I ask this as you have somehow controversially been a proponent of peace. I'm generally a proponent of peace. I mean, ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real enemy to counter it.

I mean, the plants, animals, and the jungle are constantly trying to kill each other, every single day, every minute. So it's not like, you know, we're unusual in that respect. Well, there's a relevant question here whether with greater intelligence comes greater control over these base instincts for violence? Yes, we have much more of an ability to control our limbic instinct for violence than say chimpanzee. And in fact, if 1 looks at say chimpanzee society, it is not friendly. I mean, the bonobos are an exception, but chimpanzee society is full of violence and it's quite horrific, frankly. That's our Olympic system in action. Like, you don't want to be on the wrong side of a chimpanzee. It'll eat your face off and tear your nuts off. Yeah, basically there's no limits or ethics or... The Romans had just war.

And then once in a while, somebody who's watched too many Disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet. And then that eats their face or rips their nuts off or chews their fingers off, that kind of thing. Yeah. It's happened several times. Ripping your nuts off is an interesting strategy for interaction. Some, it's happened to people, it's unfortunate. Like that's, I guess, 1 way to ensure that the other chump doesn't contribute to the gene pool. Well, from a martial arts perspective, it's a fascinating strategy. And the nut ripper. I wonder which of the martial arts teaches that. I think it's safe to say if somebody's got your nuts in their hands and has the option of rubbing them off, you will be amenable to whatever they want. Yeah. So like I said, somehow controversially, you've been a proponent of peace on Twitter on X. So let me ask you about the wars going on today and to see what the path to peace could be.

Or what my this is strictly my opinion of, you know, is that the goal of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They obviously do not expect to, you know, have a military victory. But they, they really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel. And then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the cause of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counterintuitive thing here, I think that the thing that I think should be done, even though it is very difficult, is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible. Everything. That is the actual thing that would thwart the goal of Hamas. So in some sense, the degree that makes sense in geopolitics, turn the other cheek, implemented. ",

Otherwise but In addition to that they need to do whatever they can There's some talk of establishing for example a mobile hospital. I'd recommend doing that. Just making sure that there's food, water, medical necessities, and just be over the top about it and be very transparent. So it can't go, can't claim it's a trick. Like just put a webcam on the thing, you know, all 24 7. Deploy acts of kindness. Yeah, conspicuous acts of kindness that are unequivocal, meaning they can't be somehow, because Hamas will then, their response will be, oh, it's a trick. Therefore, you have to counter how it's not a trick. This ultimately fights the broader force of hatred in the region. ",

So really, the question is like, How for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you killed, you've not succeeded. That's the, you know, the real situation there. And it's safe to say that if, you know, if, you know, if, if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few homeless members who will die just to kill an Israeli. That's the situation. So, but I mean, this is 1 of the most contentious subjects 1 could possibly discuss, but I think if the goal ultimately is some sort of long-term peace, 1 has to look at this from the standpoint of over time, are there more or fewer terrorists being created?

But it still nevertheless protects these pockets of, of flourishing. So Somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing. Yeah, I mean, I guess if we are able to 1 day expand to, you know, full the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic war at some point. Ah, the scale.

I mean, obviously there are people on the frontlines in Ukraine and Russia who understand just how terrible war is, but how many people in the West understand it. My grandfather was in World War II. He was severely traumatized. He was there for almost 6 years in Eastern North Africa and Italy. All his friends were killed in front of him and he would have died too, except they randomly gave some IQ test or something and he scored very high. Now he was not an officer, he was a corporal or sergeant or something like that because he didn't finish high school. He had to drop out of high school because his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings. So because he didn't graduate high school, he was not eligible for the officer corps. So he kind of got put into the cannon fodder category basically. But then just randomly they gave him this test. He was transferred to British intelligence in London.

But How many people, he obviously, he died 20 years ago, or longer actually, 30 years ago. How many people are alive that remember World War II? Not many. And the same perhaps applies to the threat of nuclear war. Yeah, I mean, there are enough nuclear bombs pointed at the United States to make the rubble, the radioactive rubble bounce many times. There's 2 major wars going on right now. So you talked about the threat of AGI quite a bit, but now as we sit here with the intensity of conflict going on, do you worry about nuclear war? I think we shouldn't discount the possibility of nuclear war. It is a civilizational threat. Right now, I could be wrong, but I think that the current probability of nuclear war is quite low. But there are a lot of nukes pointed at us. And we have a lot of nukes pointed at other people. They're still there. Nobody's put their guns away. The missiles are still in the silos. ",

Obviously global thermonuclear warfare has high potential to end civilization, perhaps permanently, but certainly, severely, wound and perhaps set back human progress by, the Stone Age or something, I don't know, Pretty bad. Probably scientists and engineers won't be super popular after that as well. Like you got a sense of this mess. So generally, which I think we also want to prioritize civilizational risks over things that are painful and tragic on a local level, but not civilizational. How do you hope the war in Ukraine comes to an end? And what's the path, once again, to minimizing human suffering there? Well, I think that what is likely to happen, which is really pretty much the way it is, is that something very close to the current lines will be how a ceasefire or truce happens. But you know, you just have a situation right now where whoever goes on the offensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate of whoever's on the defense. Because you've got defense in depth, you've got minefields, trenches, anti-tank defenses. Nobody has air superiority because the anti-aircraft missiles are really far better than the aircraft.

So you really just have long range artillery, and, infantry trenches. It's world war 1 all over again With drones, you know, throwing old drones, some drones there. Which makes the long range artillery just that much more accurate and better. And so more efficient at murdering people on both sides. Yeah, so it's whoever is, you don't want to be trying to advance from either side because the probability of dying is incredibly high. So in order to overcome defense in depth trenches and minefields, you really need significant local superiority in numbers. Ideally combined arms where you do a fast attack with aircraft, a concentrated number of tanks, and a lot of people, that's the only way you're going to punch through a line. And then you're going to punch through and, and then not have reinforcements just kick you right out again. I mean, I really recommend people read World War I warfare in detail. It's rough. I mean, the sheer number of people that died there was mind-boggling. And it's almost impossible to imagine the end of it that doesn't look like almost exactly like the beginning in terms of what land belongs to who and so on.

So there's a lot of sons not coming back to their parents, you know, and I think most of them don't really have, they don't hate the other side. You know, it's sort of like, as this saying about, like this saying comes from World War I, it's like young boys who don't know each other killing each other on behalf of old men that do know each other. What the hell's the point of that? So Volodymyr Zelensky said that he's not, or has said in the past, he's not interested in talking to Putin directly.

There are really, if you say like how many smart, hard-working people are there in China, there's far more of them there than there are here, I think in my opinion. And they've got a lot of energy. So I mean, the architecture in China that's in recent years is far more impressive than the US. I mean, the train stations, the buildings, the high-speed rail, everything, It's really far more impressive than what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings and go to, you know, take the train from Beijing to Xi'an where you have the terracotta warriors. China's got an incredible history, a very long history. And I think arguably in terms of the use of language from a written standpoint, sort of 1 of the oldest, perhaps the oldest written language. And then China, people did write things down. So, now China historically has always been, with rare exception, been internally focused. They've not been acquisitive. They've fought each other, they've been many, many civil wars. In the 3 Kingdoms War, I believe they lost about 70% of their population. So they had brutal internal wars, like civil wars that make the US of all look small by comparison. So I think it's important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We ",

From what I've seen, and I think most people who understand China would agree, people in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So it's like 90% of their consideration is internal. Well, isn't that a really positive thing? When you're talking about the collaboration and a future peace between superpowers, when you're inward facing, which is like focusing on improving yourself versus focusing on quote unquote improving others through military might? The good news, the history of China suggests that China is not acquisitive, meaning they're not gonna go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. I do feel very strongly, so that's good. I mean, cause a lot of very powerful countries have been acquisitive. The US is also 1 of the rare cases that has not been acquisitive. Like after World War II, the US could have basically taken over the world and any country. Like we got nukes, nobody else got nukes. We don't even have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could have taken over everything. Or at will, and it didn't. And the United States actually helped revolt countries. So it helped revolt Europe, it helped revolt Japan. This is very unusual behavior, almost unprecedented. The US did conspicuous acts of kindness, like the Berlin airlift. ",

And in fact, when Vaughn Brown took, you know, a small guy, was like, we've got to be captured by the Americans.

Now China does feel very strongly about Taiwan. They've been very clear about that for a long time. From their standpoint, it would be like 1 of the states is not there like Hawaii or something like that, but more significant than Hawaii. And Hawaii is pretty significant for us.

You know, something you said about conspicuous acts of kindness as a geopolitical policy, it almost seems naive, But I'd venture to say that this is probably the path forward, how you avoid most wars. Just as you say it, it sounds naive, but it's kind of brilliant if you believe in the goodness of underlying most of human nature. It just seems like conspicuous acts of kindness can reverberate through the populace of the countries involved. Yeah, well- And deescalate. Absolutely, So after World War I, they made a big mistake. They basically tried to lump all the blame on Germany and settled Germany with impossible reparations. And really there was quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I, but they tried to put it all on Germany. And that laid the seeds for World War II.

So I have a philosophy of curiosity.

So when you're asking important difficult questions, that's where it tends to be confidently wrong. So we're really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results. Trace things back to physics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible. That's really tricky. It is tricky.

If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it's clearly not equal to humans, let alone nor has surpass humans because humans have figured out new physics. They're just good. Physics is just understanding, deepening one's insight into how reality works. And Then there's engineering, which is inventing things that have never existed. Now, the range of possibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics because once you figure out the rules of the universe, that's it. You've discovered things that already existed. From that, you can then build technologies that are really almost limitless in the variety and, you know, it's like once you understand the rules of the game properly.

Reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I've seen plenty of people break the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics. It's a good test actually. If this LLM understands and matches physics, then you can more reliably trust whatever it thinks about the current state of politics. It's also not the case currently that even its internal logic is not consistent. So especially with the approach of just predicting a token, predict token, predict token, It's like a vector sum. You know, you're summing up a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. So as those, a little bit of error, a little bit of error adds up.

It's really just critical thinking. For something important, you need to reason with from first principles and think about things in the limit, 1 direction or the other. So in the limit, even at the Kardashev scale, meaning even if you harness the entire power of the Sun, you will still care about useful compute per watt. So that's where I think probably where things are headed from the standpoint of AI is that we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to a voltage transformer shortage in about a year. Ironically, transformers for transformers. You need transformers to run transformers. Somebody has a sense of humor in this thing. I think, yes.

So in-gy usage right now is roughly 1 third, very rough terms, 1 third electricity, 1 third transport, 1 third heating. And so in order for everything to go sustainable to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power plants and and also to probably have well, not probably they should definitely buy more batteries, because the grid currently is sized for real-time load, which is kind of crazy because That means you've got to size for whatever the peak electricity demand is, like the worst second or the worst day of the year, or you can have a brown outer blackout. And you're at that crazy blackout for several days in Austin. Because there's almost no buffering of energy in the grid.

I mean, electrification, I mean, electrification of transport and electric heating will be much bigger than AI, at least in the short term, in the short term.

Like, if you explicitly follow someone, that's 1 thing, but if you, in terms of what is recommended from people that you don't follow, that should all be AI. ",

First of all, that's fascinating because you have hundreds of millions of posts every single day and it has to pick 1500 from which it then does obviously people you follow but then there's also like some kind of clustering it has to do to figure out what kind of human are you what kind of new clusters might be relevant to you people like you this this kind of this kind of problem is just fascinating because it has to then rank those 1500 with some filtering and then recommend you just a handful. To me what's really fascinating is how fast it has to do that. So currently that entire pipeline to go from several hundreds million to handfuls takes 220 seconds of CPU time, single CPU time. Yeah. And then it has to do that in like a second. So it has to be like super distributed in fascinating ways. Like there's just a lot of tweets. ",

A tweet made sense when it was like 140 characters of text. Cause it's like a bunch of like little birds tweeting. But when you've got long-form content, it's no longer a tweet. So a movie is not a tweet. And Apple, for example, posted the entire episode of the silo, the entire thing on our platform. By the way, it was their number 1 social media thing ever in engagement, of anything on any platform ever. So it was a great idea. And by the way, I just learned about it afterwards.

So even though it's a video, there's a lot of information around it that allows you to populate the vector space of that hour long video.

Whereas I'd say on the X platform, I mean, I really get more laughs per day on X than everything else combined from humans, you know? Laughs is 1 thing. Laughs is it overlaps, but it's not necessarily perfectly overlapping with good vibes and support. Celebrating others, for example. Not in a stupid, shallow, naive way, but in an awesome way. Like, oh, something awesome happened and you celebrate them for it. It feels that that is outweighed by shitting on other people. Now it's better than mainstream media but it's still... Yeah mainstream media is almost relatively negative about everything. I mean really the conventional news tries to answer the question, what is the worst thing that happened on Earth today? And it's a big world. So on any given day, something bad has happened. And a generalization of that, what is the worst perspective I can take on a thing that happened? ",

Where, you know, bad news historically would be potentially fatal. Like this lion over there or there's some other tribe that wants to kill you. Good news, like we found a patch of berries is nice to have, but not essential. So our old friend, Tesla Autopilot, and it's probably 1 of the most intelligent real-world AI systems in the world. Right, you followed it from the beginning. Yeah, it was 1 of the most incredible robots in the world and continues to be. And it was really exciting. And it was super exciting when it generalized, became more than a robot on 4 wheels, but a real world AI system that perceives the world. Yeah. And can have potentially different embodiments. Well, I mean, the really wild thing about the end-to-end training is that it learns to read. You can read signs, but we never taught it to read. So, yeah, we never taught it what a car was or what a person was or a bicyclist. It learnt what all those things are, what all the objects are on the road from video, just from watching video, just like humans. I mean, humans are photons and control controls out. ",

        "text": "Like the vast majority of information reaching our brain is from our eyes. And you say, well, what's the output? The output is our motor signals to our fingers and mouth in order to communicate. Photon's in, control's out. The same is true of the car. But by looking at the sequence of images, it's, you've agreed with Ilyas Iskova recently where he talked about LLM forming a world model and basically language is a projection of that wall model onto a sequence of letters. It finds order in these things. It finds correlative clusters. In so doing, it's like understanding something deep about the world. Yeah. Which is like, I know it's beautiful. That's how our brain works. Yeah, but it's beautiful. It's in, it controls out. Neural nets are able to understand that deep meaning in the world. And so the question is how far can it go? And it does seem everybody's excited about LLMs. So in the space of self-supervised learning, the space of text, It seems like there's a deep similarity between that and what Tesla Autopilot is doing. Is it to you basically the same? They are converging. They are converging. I wonder who gets there faster, having a deep understanding of the world? Or they just will naturally converge? ",

        "text": "They're both headed towards AGI. The Tesla approach is much more computer-efficient. It had to be, because we were constrained on this this you know, we only have a hundred watts and It's 8 computer 144 trillion operations per second, which sounds like a lot but it's kind of small potatoes these days. That it date, but it's understanding the world at a date. So I turn for 26 values. But there the path to AGI might have much more significant impact because it's understanding. It will faster understand the real world than will LLMs and therefore for be able to integrate with, with the real humans in the real world faster. They're both going to understand the world, but I think Tesla's approach is fundamentally more computer efficient. It had to be. There was no choice. Like our brain is very computer efficient, very, very energy efficient. So think of like, what is our brain able to do? You know, there's only about 10 watts of higher brain function, not counting stuff that's just used to control our body. The thinking part of our brain is less than 10 watts. And those 10 Watts can still produce a much better novel than a 10 megawatt GPU cluster. So there's a 6 order of magnitude difference there. I mean, The AI has thus far gotten to where it is via brute force, just throwing massive amounts of compute and massive amounts of power at it. ",

        "text": "So this is not where it will end up. In general, with any given technology, first try to make it work and then you make it efficient. So I think we'll find over time that these models are able to produce sensible output with far less compute, far less power. Tesla is arguably ahead of the game on that front because we've just been forced to try to understand the world with a hundred watts of compute. And there are a bunch of sort of fundamental functions that we kind of forgot to include. So we have to run them in a bunch of things in emulation. We fixed a bunch of those with hardware 4 and then hardware 5 will be even better. But it does appear at this point that the car will be able to drive better than a human, even with hardware 3 and a hundred watts of power. And really, if we really optimize it, it could be probably less than 50 watts. What have you learned about developing Optimus, about applying, integrating this kind of real world AI into the space of robotic manipulation, just humanoid robotics? What are some interesting tiny or big things you've understood? I was surprised at the fact that we had to develop every part of the robot ourselves. That there were no off-the-shelf motors, electronics, sensors. Like we had to develop everything. We couldn't actually find a source of electric motors for any amount of money. ",

        "text": "So it's not even just efficient and expensive, it's like anything, there's not a... No. The actuators, everything, Everything has to be designed from scratch. We tried hard to find anything that was, because you think of how many electric motors are made in the world. There's like tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of electric motor designs. None of them were suitable for a humanoid robot, literally none. So we had to develop our own design, design it specifically for what a humanoid robot needs. How hard was it to design something that can be mass manufactured, could be relatively inexpensive? I mean, if you compare it to Boston Dynamics Atlas, it's a very expensive robot. It is designed to be manufactured in the same way they would make a car. And I think ultimately we can make Optimus for less than the cost of a car. It should be because if you look at the mass of the robot is much smaller and the car has many actuators in it the car is more actuators than the robot but there is the actuators are kind of interesting on a humanoid robot with fingers So Optimus has really nice hands and fingers, you know? Yeah. And they could do some interesting manipulation. So soft touch robotics. I mean, 1 of the tests goals I have is can pick up a needle and a thread and thread the needle just by looking. ",

The work that we're doing in the car will translate to the robot. The perception or also the control? No, the controls are different, but the video in controls out. The car is a robot on 4 wheels. The Optimus is a robot with hands and legs. But they're very similar. So the entire machinery of the learning process end to end is just, you just have a different set of controls. Optimus will figure out how to do things by watching videos. As the saying goes, be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Yeah, it's true.
